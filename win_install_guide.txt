1.    Install `Python 3.12.7` -
         for Windows running on an Intel chip
         https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.7/python-3.12.7-amd64.exe
      or
         for Windows running on an ARM64 chip
         https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.7/python-3.12.7-arm64.exe

      make sure that run as admin is checked
      make sure that the add to path option is checked

2.    Create a suitable parent folder such as: C:\Python

3.    Open: Powershell

4.    Expand the Powershell window to a decent size!

4.    Navigate to: C:\Python

      tip: try `cd /py` then press <tab>

5.    Run: git clone https://github.com/carlca/osmose_presets.git

6.    run: cd .\osmose_presets

      tip: try `cd os` then press <tab>

7.    Run: ./win_install

      There will be a flurry of text whizzing by. This is is okay!

      tip 1: make sure the first thing you do is press 1, then use the
      comma or period/full stop keys to choose the correct port.
      On Windows it will be something like `MIDIOUT2 (Osmose)`, possible with a 1 or 2 suffix.

9.    Then press '5', scroll to a preset and press <enter>... and play ðŸ˜‰
